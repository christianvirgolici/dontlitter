    <h1>Don't Litter, It Might Make Someone Blow Up</h1>
    <h2>By Christian Virgolici</h2>
    <p>A pufferfish finds itself in the ocean surrounded by trash. Suddenly, a cigarette bud falls into the water and drifts towards the annoyed fish, which upon contact with the cigarette bud expands, which makes the fish even angrier. <br>
        <br>
      <br>
    There are many ways to raise awareness about the effects of plastic and trash in the ocean, like banning straws. In this ad, it is done by seeing it from the pufferfish's perspective. I believe that using plastic cups, straws and mindless littering does have a real effect that needs to be given more attention. When we litter, we don't think much about who's bearing the consequences of our behavior, and therefore this ad is intended to create a connection between one's behavior and the animals that suffer from it. Therefore, be mindful when using plastic and think about where your trash might end up, because it could make someone really angry.</p>
